This initiative stemmed from many years of learning and experience gained working closely with public institutions and policy implementing partners. Over time, I noticed significant gaps in local capacity, efficiency and innovation potential, which resulted in slow progress and below-par developmental outcomesâ€”especially within food systems sectors. Although GanzAfrica was officially founded in 2022, its roots go back much further. The ideas germinated from years of observing how well-meaning policies often fell short in implementation, primarily due to a lack of capacity. This has hampered progress across many African countries, where even good solutions have also been ineffective due to their application without contextual consideration."
